# Samples of Airspace Datasets
This repository provides sample GIS datasets for features typically considered in airport airspace analysis and obstruction evaluation. Sample datasets are included for the following features:
- [Imaginary Surfaces](./imaginary_surfaces_rootgeo_sample.geojson)
- [Instrument Approach Routes](./instrument_approaches_rootgeo_sample.geojson)

The samples cover a small area in southern Wyoming and represent features associated with civil airports in Carbon and Albany counties.

Refer to the [Data Dictionary](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for more detailed information about the contents of  each dataset.

## Nationwide Datasets
For information about nationwide versions of these and related GIS datasets suitable for use in obstruction evaluation and airport airspace analyses in the US, visit [Root Geospatial - Data](https://rootgeo.com/data/).

## Intended Uses and Disclaimers
These sample datasets are intended to be used in GIS software for understanding the geographic distribution of potential aeronautical and airspace concerns that could affect prospective wind energy facilities and other tall infrastructure projects. These data should never be used for aeronautical navigation, in navigation, or as a navigation tool.

These data do not replace the need for an official FAA aeronautical study as required under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Part 77. For more information, visit https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/external/portal.jsp.

Sample datasets were created between March and July 2024, and may no longer represent current airspace features.
